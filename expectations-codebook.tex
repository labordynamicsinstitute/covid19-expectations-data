Data from a survey of consumer expectations

\hypertarget{description}{%
\subsection{Description}\label{description}}

From April 24, 2020, through June 22, 2020,
\href{http://www.fabianlange.ca/}{Fabian Lange} and
\href{https://lars.vilhuber.com}{Lars Vilhuber} conducted the survey
``Uncertainty in COVID-19 times.'' The survey is a single-question
survey focusing on people's anticipation about social distancing rules
and firm closures during the 2020 COVID-19 health crisis.

We believe that this information is not otherwise available in a
reliable and timely fashion. The information should be usable by
policy-makers and researchers, to be included in models of future
developments of society and the economy.

\hypertarget{detailed-geography}{%
\subparagraph{Detailed geography}\label{detailed-geography}}

States and provinces are codes as two-letter postal abbreviation on the

numeric FIPS or
\href{https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/dict/table-tableau/table-tableau-8-eng.cfm}{province

(\texttt{geoname}). Note that the Google-provided \texttt{Region} often,
but not always corresponds to a state or province, whereas
\texttt{State\_Province}, \texttt{geonum}, \texttt{geoname} always
correspond to state/province.

\hypertarget{data-structure}{%
\subsubsection{Data structure}\label{data-structure}}

Data files are available for each completed cycle of the survey, in
general once a week, and are stored under \href{final/}{\texttt{final}}.
Data from the preliminary study (assessing the questionnaire design) is
stored under \href{preliminary/}{\texttt{preliminary}}. We may make
available data before the survey is completed for each cycle, under
\href{temporary/}{\texttt{temporary}}, however, once the final version
from that cycle is available, these are deleted (this directory will be
empty on Zenodo).

\hypertarget{data-format}{%
\subsubsection{Data format}\label{data-format}}

Native format is Office Open XML (XLSX,
(\textbf{ecma\_international\_standard\_2016?}) ). Normalized files are
available in Stata and R formats.

Files are provided as downloaded from Google Surveys. Each file has 4
tabs.

\hypertarget{overview}{%
\paragraph{Overview}\label{overview}}

Lists the questions asked by the client, in this case Lange and
Vilhuber, as well as a survey ID.

\hypertarget{topline}{%
\paragraph{Topline}\label{topline}}

This tab contains a weighted summary of the responses to the questions
(similar to the above summary).

\hypertarget{complete-responses}{%
\paragraph{Complete responses}\label{complete-responses}}

This tab contains the actual microdata for any complete responses. Note
that for a single-question survey, this is identical to the ``All
responses.'' A complete response might have a weight of zero.

\hypertarget{all-responses}{%
\paragraph{All responses}\label{all-responses}}

All responses, whether complete or not, are recorded on this tab. In the
case of a single-question survey, this is identical to the ``Complete
responses'' tab.

\hypertarget{data-sources-and-methodology}{%
\subsection{Data sources and
methodology}\label{data-sources-and-methodology}}

\hypertarget{target-population}{%
\subsubsection{Target population}\label{target-population}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  All Canadians aged 18 and older from the ten provinces and three
  territories are eligible to participate.
\item
  All US residents aged 18 and older are eligible to participate.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{instrument-design}{%
\subsubsection{Instrument design}\label{instrument-design}}

Each individual is asked one of two questions: how long they expect
``social distancing rules'' or ``business closures'' to remain in
effect:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How much longer do you expect social distancing rules (restrictions on
  gatherings, stay-at-home rules) to stay in place in your
  province/state?
\item
  How much longer do you expect the closure of non-essential businesses
  to stay in place in your province/state?
\end{itemize}

Five response choices are offered:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``less than 1 month,''
\item
  ``1-2 months,''
\item
  ``2-3 months,''
\item
  ``3-6 months,''
\item
  ``more than 6 months.''
\end{itemize}

An additional answer allows respondents to affirm that ``such measures
are not implemented in their province/state.'' See
\protect\hyperlink{questionnaires}{questionnaires} for visual
representation of the questions.

\hypertarget{data-collection}{%
\subsubsection{Data collection}\label{data-collection}}

Data is collected via Google Surveys. For English-language surveys, data
is collected via a web form. For French-language surveys, the Android
Google Survey app is used, as web-collection in French is not possible
via Google Surveys. See (\textbf{sostek\_how\_2018?}) and
(\textbf{google\_methodology\_2020?}) for more details.

The survey questionnaire was approved by McGill University Research
Ethics Board under REB File \# 20-04-070. Exemption was issued by
Cornell University Institutional Review Board under Protocol ID\#
2004009539.

\hypertarget{sampling}{%
\subsubsection{Sampling}\label{sampling}}

Google Surveys is an online non-probability survey. It uses stratified
sampling for collection, based (in the US) on the target internet
population from the 2017 Current Population Survey (CPS) Computer and
Internet Use Supplement (\textbf{sostek\_how\_2018?};
\textbf{google\_methodology\_2020?}).

Data are collected directly from survey respondents.

For each country, we plan to collect 2500 responses per question, per
week. For Canada, a French-language variant is fielded. In order to
determine the split, we use Statistics Canada statistics on ``Languag e
spoken most often at home'' by other language(s) spoken regularly at
home and age''
(\textbf{statistics\_canada\_language\_2017?}),\footnote{Table can be
  downloaded from
  \href{https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/lang/Tables/Download/_file.cfm?Lang=E\&T=31\&Geo=00\&SP=1\&view=1\&age=1\&rl=1\&OFT=csv}{here}.}
combining responses for ``French'' and ``French and non-official
language'' (i.e., no English mentioned).

For 2016, 20.4\% spoke French and no English as the language spoken most
often at home. We thus target 510 responses via the French-language
questionnaire, and 1990 in English.

\hypertarget{imputation}{%
\subsubsection{Imputation}\label{imputation}}

All demographics are imputed by Google Surveys, if collected via web.
Demographics for respondents via the app are collected through the app.

\hypertarget{weighting}{%
\subsubsection{Weighting}\label{weighting}}

Weights are provided by Google Surveys, based on the imputed
demographics. For the US, the US Census Bureau's
\href{https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/technical-documentation/complete.2017.html}{Current
Population Survey (CPS) Computer and Internet Use Supplement} is used
(currently the 2017 version). For Canada,
(\textbf{google\_methodology\_2020?}) points to a ``combination of
government data and internal Google data sources.'' Google uses
post-stratification weighting to align the weighted demographics with
the target population.

\hypertarget{quality-evaluation}{%
\subsubsection{Quality evaluation}\label{quality-evaluation}}

A preliminary survey was conducted to allow for choice of either a
two-question variant, or a one-question variant that incluced both
social distancing and business closures (``How much longer do you expect
social distancing rules (restrictions on gatherings, closure of
non-essential businesses, stay-at-home rules) to stay in place in your
province?''). See ``\href{evaluation.md}{Uncertainty in times of
COVID-19: Choosing whether to ask 1 or 2 questions}'' for more
information.

\hypertarget{privacy-and-disclosure-control}{%
\subsubsection{Privacy and disclosure
control}\label{privacy-and-disclosure-control}}

Privacy and disclosure control are described in
(\textbf{google\_methodology\_2020?}). For most respondents, no direct
or indirect identifiers are collected, and are imputed based on other
information available to Google, but not the sponsors of the survey.

\hypertarget{response-rates}{%
\subsubsection{Response rates}\label{response-rates}}

The specific response rates are not known.
(\textbf{google\_methodology\_2020?}) reports response rates in general
for this type of data collection.

\hypertarget{funding}{%
\subsection{Funding}\label{funding}}

We acknowledge generous funding by Lange's
\href{https://www.chairs-chaires.gc.ca/chairholders-titulaires/profile-eng.aspx?profileId=3277}{Canada
Research Chair in Labour and Personnel Economics}, and by the
\href{https://www.atkinson.cornell.edu/}{Cornell Atkinson Center for
Sustainability} under its ``Rapid Response Fund'' program.
