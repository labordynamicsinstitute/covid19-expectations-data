Data from a survey of consumer expectations

## Description

Since April 24, 2020, [Fabian Lange](http://www.fabianlange.ca/) and [Lars Vilhuber](https://lars.vilhuber.com) have been conducting the survey "Uncertainty in COVID-19 times". The survey is a single-question survey focusing on people's anticipation about social distancing rules and firm closures during the 2020 COVID-19 health crisis. 

We believe that this information is not otherwise available in a reliable and timely fashion. The information should be usable by policy-makers and researchers, to be included in models of future developments of society and the economy.

#### Question type {.tabset .tabset-fade}

The actual question asked is encoded in the `tag` variable on [normalized files](#normalized-files), and differs by [geographic target](#geographic-target) (`geotag`). On the original files, geographic target is not identifiable except through the file name, and the question text is on the "Overview" tab. On the [normalized files](#normalized-files), the variables `tag` and `geotag` allow to map back to the actual question:

##### Geographic target

Encoded in `geotag` on [normalized files](#normalized-files), and specifies the two-letter geocode (country or postal abbreviation) as targeted on the Google Survey platform. Note: `geotag` = `qc` also identifies the surveys that used the app.

##### Notes

- in Week 1 (2020-04-24), we ran  a French-language app survey geo-targeted for Canada, and another one targeted at Québec only. In subsequent weeks, we ran the French-language app survey only in Québec.
- in Week 3 (2020-05-10), we ran a supplementary web survey geo-targeted at New York State.

#### Geography {.tabset .tabset-fade}

Geography is as coded by Google Surveys. Precision may vary, having country, region, province, and sometimes city. Note that this may be different from the [targeted geography](#geographic-target).


##### Detailed geography

The variable `Geography` corresponds to the geography as captured and recorded by Google. All other geography variables are derived from this variable, and are only available on the [normalized files](#normalized-files).

##### Region

Regions may be single states or provinces, or larger collections. They may correspond to US Census regions or [Statistics Canada regions](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/dict/table-tableau/table-tableau-8-eng.cfm).

##### States/Province

States and provinces are codes as two-letter postal abbreviation on the original data files. On derived files, `geonum`  contains the numeric FIPS or [province code](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/dict/table-tableau/table-tableau-8-eng.cfm) (coded as character to preserve leading zeros), and as a full name (`geoname`). Note that the Google-provided `Region` often, but not always corresponds to a state or province, whereas `State_Province`, `geonum`, `geoname` always correspond to state/province.

#### Not tabulated

- `Survey_Completion`

### Data structure

Data files are available for each completed cycle of the survey, in general once a week, and are stored under [`final`](final/). Data from the preliminary study (assessing the questionnaire design) is stored under [`preliminary`](preliminary/). We may make available data before the survey is completed for each cycle, under [`temporary`](temporary/), however, once the final version from that cycle is available, these are deleted (this directory will be empty on Zenodo).


### Data format

Native format is Office Open XML (XLSX, @ecma_international_standard_2016 ). Normalized files are available in Stata and R formats.

Files are provided as downloaded from Google Surveys. Each file has 4 tabs.

#### Overview

Lists the questions asked by the client, in this case Lange and Vilhuber, as well as a survey ID.

#### Topline

This tab contains a weighted summary of the responses to the questions (similar to the above summary). 

#### Complete responses

This tab contains the actual microdata for any complete responses. Note that for a single-question survey, this is identical to the "All responses". A complete response might have a weight of zero.

#### All responses

All responses, whether complete or not, are recorded on this tab. In the case of a single-question survey, this is identical to the "Complete responses" tab.

## Data sources and methodology  


### Target population

- All Canadians aged 18 and older from the ten provinces and three territories are eligible to participate.
- All US residents aged 18 and older are eligible to participate.

### Instrument design  


Each individual is asked one of two questions: how long they expect "social distancing rules" or "business closures" to remain in effect:

- How much longer do you expect social distancing rules (restrictions on gatherings, stay-at-home rules) to stay in place in your province/state?
- How much longer do you expect the closure of non-essential businesses to stay in place in your province/state?

Five response choices are offered: 

- "less than 1 month", 
- "1-2 months", 
- "2-3 months", 
- "3-6 months", 
- "more than 6 months". 

An additional answer allows respondents to affirm that "such measures are not implemented in their province/state". See [questionnaires](#questionnaires) for visual representation of the questions. 


### Questionnaires


<img src="questionnaires/Screenshot_Survey1_consumer.png" width="200px" />
<img src="questionnaires/Screenshot_Survey2_closures.png" width="200px" />

### Data collection

Data is collected via Google Surveys. For English-language surveys, data is collected via a web form. For French-language surveys, the Android Google Survey app is used, as web-collection in French is not possible via Google Surveys. See @sostek_how_2018 and @google_methodology_2020 for more details.

The survey questionnaire was approved by McGill University Research Ethics Board under REB File # 20-04-070. Exemption was issued by Cornell University Institutional Review Board under Protocol ID# 2004009539.

### Sampling

Google Surveys is an online non-probability survey. It uses  stratified sampling for collection, based (in the US) on the target internet population from the  2017 Current Population Survey (CPS) Computer and Internet Use Supplement [@sostek_how_2018;@google_methodology_2020]. 

Data are collected directly from survey respondents.

For each country, we plan to collect 2500 responses per question, per week. For Canada, a French-language variant is fielded. In order to determine the split, we use Statistics Canada statistics on "Languag
e spoken most often at home" by other language(s) spoken regularly at home and age" [@statistics_canada_language_2017],^[Table can be downloaded from [here](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/lang/Tables/Download/_file.cfm?Lang=E&T=31&Geo=00&SP=1&view=1&age=1&rl=1&OFT=csv).] combining responses for "French" and "French and non-official language" (i.e., no English mentioned).

For 2016, 20.4% spoke French and no English as the language spoken most often at home. We thus target 510 responses via the French-language questionnaire, and 1990 in English.



### Imputation

All demographics are imputed by Google Surveys, if collected via web. Demographics for respondents via the app are collected through the app. 

### Weighting 

Weights are provided by Google Surveys, based on the imputed demographics. For the US, the US Census Bureau's [Current Population Survey (CPS) Computer and Internet Use Supplement](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/technical-documentation/complete.2017.html) is used (currently the 2017 version). For Canada, @google_methodology_2020 points to a "combination of government data and internal Google data sources." Google uses  post-stratification weighting to align the weighted demographics with the target population. 

### Quality evaluation

A preliminary survey was conducted to allow for choice of either a two-question variant, or a one-question variant that incluced both social distancing and business closures ("How much longer do you expect social distancing rules (restrictions on gatherings, closure of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home rules) to stay in place in your province?"). See "[Uncertainty in times of COVID-19: Choosing whether to ask 1 or 2 questions](evaluation.md)" for more information. 



### Privacy and disclosure control

Privacy and disclosure control are described in @google_methodology_2020. For most respondents, no direct or indirect identifiers are collected, and are imputed based on other information available to Google, but not the sponsors of the survey. 

### Response rates

The specific response rates are not known. @google_methodology_2020 reports response rates in general for this type of data collection.
