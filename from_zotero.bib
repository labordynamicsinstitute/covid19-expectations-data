            We develop a new index of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) based on newspaper coverage frequency. Several types of evidence—including human readings of 12,000 newspaper articles—indicate that our index proxies for movements in policy-related economic uncertainty. Our U.S. index spikes near tight presidential elections, Gulf Wars I and II, the 9/11 attacks, the failure of Lehman Brothers, the 2011 debt ceiling dispute, and other major battles over fiscal policy. Using firm-level data, we find that policy uncertainty is associated with greater stock price volatility and reduced investment and employment in policy-sensitive sectors like defense, health care, finance, and infrastructure construction. At the macro level, innovations in policy uncertainty foreshadow declines in investment, output, and employment in the United States and, in a panel vector autoregressive setting, for 12 major economies. Extending our U.S. index back to 1900, EPU rose dramatically in the 1930s (from late 1931) and has drifted upward since the 1960s.},

	abstract = {In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the US government brought about a collection of fiscal stimulus measures: the 2020 CARES Act. Among other provisions, this Act directed cash payments to households. We analyze households' spending responses using high-frequency transaction data. We also explore heterogeneity by income levels, recent income declines, and liquidity. We find that households respond rapidly to receipt of stimulus payments, with spending increasing by {\textbackslash}\$0.25-{\textbackslash}\$0.35 per dollar of stimulus during the first 10 days. Households with lower incomes, greater income drops, and lower levels of liquidity display stronger responses. Liquidity plays the most important role, with no observed spending response for households with high levels of bank account balances. Relative to the effects of previous economic stimulus programs in 2001 and 2008, we see much smaller increases in durables spending and larger increases in spending on food, likely reflecting the impact of shelter-in-place orders and supply disruptions. We hope that our results inform the current debate about appropriate policy measures.},

	abstract = {Assessing the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for policymakers, but challenging because the crisis has unfolded with extreme speed. We identify three indicators – stock market volatility, newspaper-based economic uncertainty, and subjective uncertainty in business expectation surveys – that provide real-time forward-looking uncertainty measures. We use these indicators to document and quantify the enormous increase in economic uncertainty in the past several weeks. We also illustrate how these forward-looking measures can be used to assess the macroeconomic impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Specifically, we feed COVID-induced first-moment and uncertainty shocks into an estimated model of disaster effects developed by Baker, Bloom and Terry (2020). Our illustrative exercise implies a year-on-year contraction in U.S. real GDP of nearly 11 percent as of 2020 Q4, with a 90 percent confidence interval extending to a nearly 20 percent contraction. The exercise says that about half of the forecasted output contraction reflects a negative effect of COVID-induced uncertainty.},

	abstract = {This project will study labor market outcomes and time use by US households during the 2020 Coronavirus outbreak. We are particularly interested in the effect of the outbreak on three interrelated areas. First, how did the outbreak impact labor market outcomes such as employment, hours worked, and income. Second, how did the closure of schools and daycare facilities impact the childcare practices and time useof parents? Third, what are the  broad  patterns  of  social  distancing  adopted  by  households,  and  how  are  social distancing practices affected by shocks to labor market outcomes and childcare availability.In principle,data sets collected by the Bureau ofLabor Statistics (BLS)/US Census Bureau would  allowusto  address  these  questions,  but  unfortunately  not  in  real  time.  The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) will most likely not be available for severalyears.The Current Population Survey (CPS) is conducted monthly, but the results are released with a significant lag. TheBLS will release the Employment Situationreport, based on the CPS, onApril3, but this will only reflectoutcomesin the week of March 12, which precedes major effects of the Coronaviruscrisis on the labor market. This means that CPS data reflecting the  post-Coronaviruslabor  market  will  not  be  available  until  the  MayEmployment Situation reportis released. Further, the micro data associated with this report is released on an additionaldelay, and may not be available until late May or later.In response to this dearth of data, we are launching abi-weeklyonline survey. Our goals are to (1) provide a real time picture of the labor market, and (2) to fill the gaps between monthly  CPS releases,  which  is  important  given  the  rapidly  changing  nature  of  the Coronavirus pandemic},
