	abstract = {This project will study labor market outcomes and time use by US households during the 2020 Coronavirus outbreak. We are particularly interested in the effect of the outbreak on three interrelated areas. First, how did the outbreak impact labor market outcomes such as employment, hours worked, and income. Second, how did the closure of schools and daycare facilities impact the childcare practices and time useof parents? Third, what are the  broad  patterns  of  social  distancing  adopted  by  households,  and  how  are  social distancing practices affected by shocks to labor market outcomes and childcare availability.In principle,data sets collected by the Bureau ofLabor Statistics (BLS)/US Census Bureau would  allowusto  address  these  questions,  but  unfortunately  not  in  real  time.  The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) will most likely not be available for severalyears.The Current Population Survey (CPS) is conducted monthly, but the results are released with a significant lag. TheBLS will release the Employment Situationreport, based on the CPS, onApril3, but this will only reflectoutcomesin the week of March 12, which precedes major effects of the Coronaviruscrisis on the labor market. This means that CPS data reflecting the  post-Coronaviruslabor  market  will  not  be  available  until  the  MayEmployment Situation reportis released. Further, the micro data associated with this report is released on an additionaldelay, and may not be available until late May or later.In response to this dearth of data, we are launching abi-weeklyonline survey. Our goals are to (1) provide a real time picture of the labor market, and (2) to fill the gaps between monthly  CPS releases,  which  is  important  given  the  rapidly  changing  nature  of  the Coronavirus pandemic},
