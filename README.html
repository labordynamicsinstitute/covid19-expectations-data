<p>Data from a survey of consumer expectations</p>
<div id="description" class="section level2">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>From April 24, 2020, Fabian Lange and Lars Vilhuber will conduct the survey “Uncertainty in COVID-19 times”. The survey is a single-question survey focusing on people’s anticipation about social distancing rules and firm closures during the 2020 COVID-19 health crisis.</p>
<p>We believe that this information is not otherwise available in a reliable and timely fashion. The information should be usable by policy-makers and researchers, to be included in models of future developments of society and the economy.</p>
<div id="citation" class="section level3">
<h3>Citation</h3>
<p>Please cite the data as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lange, Fabian and Lars Vilhuber. 2020. “Expectations about Continuation of Social Distancing Rules in COVID-19 Times [dataset].” (this URL)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will be posting the data on Zenodo shortly. Data should be cite via DOI then.</p>

<ul>
<li>How much longer do you expect social distancing rules (restrictions on gatherings, stay-at-home rules) to stay in place in your province/state?</li>
<li>How much longer do you expect the closure of non-essential businesses to stay in place in your province/state?</li>
</ul>
<p>Five response choices are offered:</p>
<ul>
<li>“less than 1 month”,</li>
<li>“1-2 months”,</li>
<li>“2-3 months”,</li>
<li>“3-6 months”,</li>
<li>“more than 6 months”.</li>
</ul>
<p>An additional answer allows respondents to affirm that “such measures are not implemented in their province/state”. See <a href="#questionnaires">questionnaires</a> for visual representation of the questions.</p>

<div id="data-collection" class="section level3">
<h3>Data collection</h3>
<p>Data is collected via Google Surveys. For English-language surveys, data is collected via a web form. For French-language surveys, the Android Google Survey app is used, as web-collection in French is not possible via Google Surveys. See <span class="citation">Sostek and Slatkin (2018)</span> and <span class="citation">Google (2020)</span> for more details.</p>
</div>
<div id="sampling" class="section level3">
<h3>Sampling</h3>
<p>Google Surveys is an online non-probability survey. It uses stratified sampling for collection, based (in the US) on the target internet population from the 2017 Current Population Survey (CPS) Computer and Internet Use Supplement <span class="citation">(Sostek and Slatkin 2018; Google 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Data are collected directly from survey respondents.</p>
<p>For each country, we plan to collect 2500 responses per question, per week. For Canada, a French-language variant is fielded. In order to determine the split, we use Statistics Canada statistics on “Languag e spoken most often at home” by other language(s) spoken regularly at home and age" <span class="citation">(Statistics Canada 2017)</span>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> combining responses for “French” and “French and non-official language” (i.e., no English mentioned).</p>
<p>For 2016, 20.4% spoke French and no English as the language spoken most often at home. We thus target 510 responses via the French-language questionnaire, and 1990 in English.</p>
</div>
<div id="imputation" class="section level3">
<h3>Imputation</h3>
<p>All demographics are imputed by Google Surveys, if collected via web. Demographics for respondents via the app are collected through the app.</p>
</div>
<div id="quality-evaluation" class="section level3">
<h3>Quality evaluation</h3>
<p>A preliminary survey was conducted to allow for choice of either a two-question variant, or a one-question variant that incluced both social distancing and business closures (“How much longer do you expect social distancing rules (restrictions on gatherings, closure of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home rules) to stay in place in your province?”). See “<a href="evaluation.md">Uncertainty in times of COVID-19: Choosing whether to ask 1 or 2 questions</a>” for more information.</p>
</div>
<div id="privacy-and-disclosure-control" class="section level3">
<h3>Privacy and disclosure control</h3>
<p>Privacy and disclosure control are described in <span class="citation">Google (2020)</span>. For most respondents, no direct or indirect identifiers are collected, and are imputed based on other information available to Google, but not the sponsors of the survey.</p>
</div>
<div id="response-rates" class="section level3">
<h3>Response rates</h3>
<p>The specific response rates are not known. <span class="citation">Google (2020)</span> reports response rates in general for this type of data collection.</p>
