Data from a survey of consumer expectations

## Description

From April 24, 2020, Fabian Lange and Lars Vilhuber will conduct the survey "Uncertainty in COVID-19 times". The survey is a single-question survey focusing on people's anticipation about social distancing rules and firm closures during the 2020 COVID-19 health crisis. 

We believe that this information is not otherwise available in a reliable and timely fashion. The information should be usable by policy-makers and researchers, to be included in models of future developments of society and the economy.

## Available data {.tabset .tabset-fade}


### Final files

Final files are uploaded after each wave is completed. Filenames in [`final`](final/) tagged with geography, language, the question type,and date downloaded:

> `survey-[geography]-[language]-[question]-[date].xlsx`

### List of files

```{r listfiles,results='asis'}
ws %>% select(showpath,filename) %>% 
  mutate(Files=paste0("[",filename,"](",file.path(showpath,filename),")"))  %>%
  select(Files) %>% kable()
```

### Normalized file (Stata)

We provide a normalized Stata file with all surveys, recoded consistently.

```{r liststata,results='asis'}

enframe(list.files(derived,"*.dta")) %>% 
    mutate(filename=value,path=derived) %>% 
    mutate(showpath=str_remove(path,paste0(basepath,"/"))) %>% 
  select(showpath,filename) %>% 
  mutate(Files=paste0("[",filename,"](",file.path(showpath,filename),")"))  %>%
  select(Files) %>% kable()
```

### Temporary files

Temporary files may be made available if a survey has not yet completed, but data are already available. 

[`Temporary`](temporary/) files follow

> `survey-[surveyid].xlsx`



## Data description

|  Topic | Answer |
|--------|--------|
| Geographic Coverage | United States of America, Canada |
| Time  Periods | `r dates.final.begin` - `r dates.final.end` |
| Date of Collection | `r dates.final.begin` - `r dates.final.end` |
| Unit of Observation | Individual |
| Description of Variables | `r names(results)[1:10] ` |


### Reference period

The survey asks about point-in-time expectations. A new wave is launched every Friday. The list  provides the dates of collection for each wave. Currently, data are available covering the period between `r dates.final.begin` and `r dates.final.end`.

```{r}
library(DT)
ws.with.dates %>% 
  mutate(`Files` = file.path(showpath,filename)) %>%
  select(Files, begintime, endtime) %>% 
  arrange(begintime) %>%
  datatable(autoHideNavigation = TRUE)

```

### Data Dictionary

#### Q1: Answer to primary question {.tabset .tabset-fade}

This field will differ across the two types of files, geography, and languages. A consolidated (standardized) distribution is shown below, using the [standardizer mapping](`r str_remove(standardizer_file,paste0(basepath,"/"))`).

##### Standardized distribution

The following tabulations are of unweighted data.

```{r graph, echo=FALSE}
results.final %>% 
  mutate(tag = if_else(tag %in% c("businesses","people"),tag,"temporary")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Q1,color=tag,fill=tag)) +
  geom_histogram(stat="count",position="dodge",aes(label=..count..)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") +
  ylab(element_blank())+
  xlab(element_blank())+
  coord_flip()
```


```{r q1details, include=FALSE}
tmp <- left_join(results,
                      ws.with.dates %>% select(filename,geography,language),
                      by=c("source" = "filename")) %>%
  # insert Québec into Canada
  mutate(geography = recode(geography,"qc" = "canada")) %>%
  group_by(tag,geography,language,`Question #1 Answer`) %>%
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  group_by(tag,geography,language) %>%
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count)) 

tags <- c("business","people")

print.part <- function(ds,tagselect,geo,lang) {
  ds %>% filter(tag==tagselect & geography == geo & language == lang) %>% 
    mutate(percent = round(percent*100,2)) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
    select(-tag,-geography,-language) %>%
  kable() %>%
  return()
}

tabulate.var <- function(var,df=results.final) {
  quo_var = enquo(var)
  
  df %>% 
  group_by(!! quo_var) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count)) %>%
  mutate(percent = round(percent*100,2)) %>% return()
}
```
##### People, Canada, English

```{r details_p_c_e}
print.part(ds=tmp,tagselect = "people",geo = "canada",lang = "en")
```

##### Business, Canada, French

```{r details_b_c_f}
print.part(ds=tmp,tagselect = "businesses",geo = "canada",lang = "fr")
```

#### Geography {.tabset .tabset-fade}

Geography is as coded by Google Surveys. Precision may vary, having country, region, province, and sometimes city.

Distribution across countries

```{r details_country}
results.final  -> geo
tabulate.var(Country,df=geo) %>% datatable(autoHideNavigation = TRUE,options = list(dom = 't'))
```

##### Regions

Regions may be single states or provinces, or larger collections.

```{r details_regions}
tabulate.var(Region,df=geo) %>% datatable(autoHideNavigation = TRUE)
```

##### States/Provinces

```{r details_state_province}
tabulate.var(`State/Province`,df=geo) %>% datatable(autoHideNavigation = TRUE)
```

##### Cities

In some cases, details is available at the city level.

```{r details_cities}
tabulate.var(City,df=geo) %>% datatable(autoHideNavigation = TRUE)
```


##### Detailed geography

```{r details_geography}
tabulate.var(Geography) %>% datatable() 
```

#### Weight

See elsewhere in this document how weights are computed.

```{r details_weights,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE,error=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(summarytools)
results.final %>% select(Weight) %>% descr(stats="common") %>% 
  datatable(autoHideNavigation = TRUE,options = list(dom = 't')) %>%
  formatRound(columns=c("Weight"),digits=4)
```

#### Response Time

```{r details_responsetime}
results.final %>% select(rt_Q1_ms) %>% descr(stats="common") %>% 
  datatable(autoHideNavigation = TRUE,options = list(dom = 't')) %>%
  formatRound(columns=c("rt_Q1_ms"),digits=4)
detach("package:summarytools",unload=TRUE)
```

#### Publisher Category

```{r details_publisher}
tabulate.var(`Publisher Category`) %>% datatable(autoHideNavigation = TRUE,options = list(dom = 't')) 
```

#### Not tabulated

- `User ID`
- `Time (UTC)`
- `Survey Completion`

### Data structure

Data files are available for each completed cycle of the survey, in general once a week, and are stored under [`final`](final/). Data from the preliminary study (assessing the questionnaire design) is stored under [`preliminary`](preliminary/). We may make available data before the survey is completed for each cycle, under [`temporary`](temporary/), however, once the final version from that cycle is available, these are deleted (this directory will be empty on Zenodo).


### Data format

Native format is Excel (XLSX). 

Files are provided as downloaded from Google Surveys. Each file has 4 tabs.

#### Overview

Lists the questions asked by the client, in this case Lange and Vilhuber, as well as a survey ID.

#### Topline

This tab contains a weighted summary of the responses to the questions (similar to the above summary). 

#### Complete responses

This tab contains the actual microdata for any complete responses. Note that for a single-question survey, this is identical to the "All responses". A complete response might have a weight of zero.

#### All responses

All responses, whether complete or not, are recorded on this tab. In the case of a single-question survey, this is identical to the "Complete responses" tab.

## Data sources and methodology  


### Target population

- All Canadians aged 18 and older from the ten provinces and three territories are eligible to participate.
- All US residents aged 18 and older are eligible to participate.

### Instrument design  


Each individual is asked one of two questions: how long they expect "social distancing rules" or "business closures" to remain in effect:

- How much longer do you expect social distancing rules (restrictions on gatherings, stay-at-home rules) to stay in place in your province/state?
- How much longer do you expect the closure of non-essential businesses to stay in place in your province/state?

Five response choices are offered: 

- "less than 1 month", 
- "1-2 months", 
- "2-3 months", 
- "3-6 months", 
- "more than 6 months". 

An additional answer allows respondents to affirm that "such measures are not implemented in their province/state". See [questionnaires](#questionnaires) for visual representation of the questions. 


### Questionnaires


<img src="questionnaires/Screenshot_Survey1_consumer.png" width="200px" />
<img src="questionnaires/Screenshot_Survey2_closures.png" width="200px" />

### Data collection

Data is collected via Google Surveys. For English-language surveys, data is collected via a web form. For French-language surveys, the Android Google Survey app is used, as web-collection in French is not possible via Google Surveys. See @sostek_how_2018 and @google_methodology_2020 for more details.

The survey questionnaire was approved by McGill University Research Ethics Board under REB File # 20-04-070. Exemption was issued by Cornell University Institutional Review Board under Protocol ID# 2004009539.

### Sampling

Google Surveys is an online non-probability survey. It uses  stratified sampling for collection, based (in the US) on the target internet population from the  2017 Current Population Survey (CPS) Computer and Internet Use Supplement [@sostek_how_2018;@google_methodology_2020]. 

Data are collected directly from survey respondents.

For each country, we plan to collect 2500 responses per question, per week. For Canada, a French-language variant is fielded. In order to determine the split, we use Statistics Canada statistics on "Languag
e spoken most often at home" by other language(s) spoken regularly at home and age" [@statistics_canada_language_2017],^[Table can be downloaded from [here](`r statcan_languages$url`).] combining responses for "French" and "French and non-official language" (i.e., no English mentioned).
```{r sample_sizes_canada, include=FALSE}
# computing language fraction in Canada
languages <- readr::read_csv(url(statcan_languages$url))
languages %>% filter(`Geographic code`=="01") -> languages.cdn
total = languages.cdn %>% select(value = `Language spoken most often at home: Total`) %>% pull(value)
french = languages.cdn %>% select(value = `Language spoken most often at home: French`) %>% pull(value)
frenchalt = languages.cdn %>% 
  select(value = `Language spoken most often at home: French and non-official language`) %>% 
  pull(value)
frenchpct <- round(( french + frenchalt ) / total,3)
target_french <- round(target * frenchpct,0)
```
For 2016, `r frenchpct*100`% spoke French and no English as the language spoken most often at home. We thus target `r target_french` responses via the French-language questionnaire, and `r target - target_french` in English.



### Imputation

All demographics are imputed by Google Surveys, if collected via web. Demographics for respondents via the app are collected through the app. 

### Quality evaluation

A preliminary survey was conducted to allow for choice of either a two-question variant, or a one-question variant that incluced both social distancing and business closures ("How much longer do you expect social distancing rules (restrictions on gatherings, closure of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home rules) to stay in place in your province?"). See "[Uncertainty in times of COVID-19: Choosing whether to ask 1 or 2 questions](evaluation.md)" for more information. 



### Privacy and disclosure control

Privacy and disclosure control are described in @google_methodology_2020. For most respondents, no direct or indirect identifiers are collected, and are imputed based on other information available to Google, but not the sponsors of the survey. 

### Response rates

The specific response rates are not known. @google_methodology_2020 reports response rates in general for this type of data collection.
