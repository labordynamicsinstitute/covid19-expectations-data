<p>Data from a survey of consumer expectations</p>
<div id="description" class="section level2">
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Since April 24, 2020, <a href="http://www.fabianlange.ca/">Fabian Lange</a> and <a href="https://lars.vilhuber.com">Lars Vilhuber</a> have been conducting the survey &quot;Uncertainty in COVID-19 times&quot;. The survey is a single-question survey focusing on people's anticipation about social distancing rules and firm closures during the 2020 COVID-19 health crisis.</p>
<p>We believe that this information is not otherwise available in a reliable and timely fashion. The information should be usable by policy-makers and researchers, to be included in models of future developments of society and the economy.</p>

<h5>States/Province</h5>
<p>States and provinces are codes as two-letter postal abbreviation on the original data files. On derived files, <code>geonum</code> contains the numeric FIPS or <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/ref/dict/table-tableau/table-tableau-8-eng.cfm">province code</a> (coded as character to preserve leading zeros), and as a full name (<code>geoname</code>). Note that the Google-provided <code>Region</code> often, but not always corresponds to a state or province, whereas <code>State_Province</code>, <code>geonum</code>, <code>geoname</code> always correspond to state/province.</p>

<p>Native format is Office Open XML (XLSX, <span class="citation">ECMA International (2016)</span> ). Normalized files are available in Stata and R formats.</p>
<p>Files are provided as downloaded from Google Surveys. Each file has 4 tabs.</p>
<div id="overview" class="section level4">
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Lists the questions asked by the client, in this case Lange and Vilhuber, as well as a survey ID.</p>
</div>
<div id="topline" class="section level4">
<h4>Topline</h4>
<p>This tab contains a weighted summary of the responses to the questions (similar to the above summary).</p>
</div>
<div id="complete-responses" class="section level4">
<h4>Complete responses</h4>
<p>This tab contains the actual microdata for any complete responses. Note that for a single-question survey, this is identical to the &quot;All responses&quot;. A complete response might have a weight of zero.</p>
</div>
<div id="all-responses" class="section level4">
<h4>All responses</h4>
<p>All responses, whether complete or not, are recorded on this tab. In the case of a single-question survey, this is identical to the &quot;Complete responses&quot; tab.</p>
</div>

<div id="data-sources-and-methodology" class="section level2">
<h2>Data sources and methodology</h2>
<div id="target-population" class="section level3">
<h3>Target population</h3>
<ul>
<li>All Canadians aged 18 and older from the ten provinces and three territories are eligible to participate.</li>
<li>All US residents aged 18 and older are eligible to participate.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="instrument-design" class="section level3">
<h3>Instrument design</h3>
<p>Each individual is asked one of two questions: how long they expect &quot;social distancing rules&quot; or &quot;business closures&quot; to remain in effect:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much longer do you expect social distancing rules (restrictions on gatherings, stay-at-home rules) to stay in place in your province/state?</li>
<li>How much longer do you expect the closure of non-essential businesses to stay in place in your province/state?</li>
</ul>
<p>Five response choices are offered:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;less than 1 month&quot;,</li>
<li>&quot;1-2 months&quot;,</li>
<li>&quot;2-3 months&quot;,</li>
<li>&quot;3-6 months&quot;,</li>
<li>&quot;more than 6 months&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>An additional answer allows respondents to affirm that &quot;such measures are not implemented in their province/state&quot;. See <a href="#questionnaires">questionnaires</a> for visual representation of the questions.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div id="data-collection" class="section level3">
<h3>Data collection</h3>
<p>Data is collected via Google Surveys. For English-language surveys, data is collected via a web form. For French-language surveys, the Android Google Survey app is used, as web-collection in French is not possible via Google Surveys. See <span class="citation">Sostek and Slatkin (2018)</span> and <span class="citation">Google (2020)</span> for more details.</p>
<p>The survey questionnaire was approved by McGill University Research Ethics Board under REB File # 20-04-070. Exemption was issued by Cornell University Institutional Review Board under Protocol ID# 2004009539.</p>
</div>
<div id="sampling" class="section level3">
<h3>Sampling</h3>
<p>Google Surveys is an online non-probability survey. It uses stratified sampling for collection, based (in the US) on the target internet population from the 2017 Current Population Survey (CPS) Computer and Internet Use Supplement <span class="citation">(Sostek and Slatkin 2018; Google 2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Data are collected directly from survey respondents.</p>
<p>For each country, we plan to collect 2500 responses per question, per week. For Canada, a French-language variant is fielded. In order to determine the split, we use Statistics Canada statistics on &quot;Languag e spoken most often at home&quot; by other language(s) spoken regularly at home and age&quot; <span class="citation">(Statistics Canada 2017)</span>,<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> combining responses for &quot;French&quot; and &quot;French and non-official language&quot; (i.e., no English mentioned).</p>
<p>For 2016, 20.4% spoke French and no English as the language spoken most often at home. We thus target 510 responses via the French-language questionnaire, and 1990 in English.</p>
</div>
<div id="imputation" class="section level3">
<h3>Imputation</h3>
<p>All demographics are imputed by Google Surveys, if collected via web. Demographics for respondents via the app are collected through the app.</p>
</div>
<div id="weighting" class="section level3">
<h3>Weighting</h3>
<p>Weights are provided by Google Surveys, based on the imputed demographics. For the US, the US Census Bureau's <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/technical-documentation/complete.2017.html">Current Population Survey (CPS) Computer and Internet Use Supplement</a> is used (currently the 2017 version). For Canada, <span class="citation">Google (2020)</span> points to a &quot;combination of government data and internal Google data sources.&quot; Google uses post-stratification weighting to align the weighted demographics with the target population.</p>
</div>
<div id="quality-evaluation" class="section level3">
<h3>Quality evaluation</h3>
<p>A preliminary survey was conducted to allow for choice of either a two-question variant, or a one-question variant that incluced both social distancing and business closures (&quot;How much longer do you expect social distancing rules (restrictions on gatherings, closure of non-essential businesses, stay-at-home rules) to stay in place in your province?&quot;). See &quot;<a href="evaluation.md">Uncertainty in times of COVID-19: Choosing whether to ask 1 or 2 questions</a>&quot; for more information.</p>
</div>
<div id="privacy-and-disclosure-control" class="section level3">
<h3>Privacy and disclosure control</h3>
<p>Privacy and disclosure control are described in <span class="citation">Google (2020)</span>. For most respondents, no direct or indirect identifiers are collected, and are imputed based on other information available to Google, but not the sponsors of the survey.</p>
</div>
<div id="response-rates" class="section level3">
<h3>Response rates</h3>
<p>The specific response rates are not known. <span class="citation">Google (2020)</span> reports response rates in general for this type of data collection.</p>
