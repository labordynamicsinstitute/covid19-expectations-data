# Uncertainty in times of COVID-19: Raw survey data

Fabian Lange, Lars Vilhuber

Data from a survey of consumer expectations

## Description

From April 24, 2020, through June 22, 2020, Fabian Lange and Lars Vilhuber conducted the survey "Uncertainty in COVID-19 times". The survey is a single-question survey focusing on people's anticipation about social distancing rules and firm closures during the 2020 COVID-19 health crisis. 

We believe that this information is not otherwise available in a reliable and timely fashion. The information should be usable by policy-makers and researchers, to be included in models of future developments of society and the economy.
